# InboxShore ðŸŒŠ

A modern, full-stack customer support portal. Built with intention, crafted for human connection.

## What This Is

InboxShore is a demonstration of what happens when engineering meets empathy. It's a standalone product that shows how support software should feel, fast, accessible, and genuinely helpful. No external dependencies, no third-party API reliance. Just clean architecture and thoughtful design from the ground up.

This project includes test messages from some of my favorite musicians, Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers, Sharon Van Etten, and Julien Baker, as an ode to art that moves you. Because good software, like good music, should make you feel something.

## The Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js with custom JWT authentication
- **State Management**: React Query (with optimistic updates)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Headless UI
- **Form & Validation**: React Hook Form, Zod
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Mock Data**: Faker.js-powered mock server
- **Quality Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Biome, Husky (pre-commit hooks), EditorConfig
- **Documentation**: Swagger (OpenAPI), Markdown
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose, Vercel
- **Other**: Custom error boundaries, Winston logging, Rate limiting middleware, Custom React hooks and context

## What Makes This Different

### Performance Without Compromise

- Reverse pagination that respects conversation flow
- Request batching and intelligent caching
- Skeleton loaders that actually improve perceived performance
- Component memoization where it matters

### Accessibility First

- Full keyboard navigation with thoughtful shortcuts
- Screen reader optimizations throughout
- Focus management that follows natural reading patterns
- Error states that help rather than frustrate

### Built for Real Humans

- Optimistic updates so conversations feel instant
- Centralized error handling that's actually helpful
- HTTP-only JWT cookies for security without friction
- Responsive design that works everywhere

### Production-Ready

- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Winston logging with context
- Rate limiting and security headers
- Docker containerization
- API documentation that developers will actually use

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd server && npm install && cd ..

# Run locally (frontend on :3000, server on :3001)
npm run dev

# Run with Docker
docker-compose up
# Frontend available at http://localhost:3000
# API available at http://localhost:3001

# Run tests
npm test

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel
```

## Design Decisions

Every choice here was deliberate:

- Mocked data over real APIs: This is about showing craft, not integrations
- JWT in HTTP-only cookies: Security that doesn't get in the way
- React Query over Redux: Because server state is different from client state
- Tailwind over CSS-in-JS: Performance and maintainability at scale
- Express over serverless: Sometimes you need a real server
- TypeScript everywhere: Type safety is user safety

## What I Learned Building This

InboxShore taught me that the best software is invisible. It's there when you need it, gone when you don't. It respects your time, your data, and your humanity.

Good error handling isn't about catching errors, it's about helping people recover from them. Good performance isn't about milliseconds, it's about making interactions feel effortless. Good design isn't about beauty, it's about removing friction from human tasks.

## Contributing
